    <h1>Hanumangarh</h1>
    <p>Hanumangarh is a city and municipal council in the Indian state of Rajasthan, situated on the banks of the <br>
        river Ghaggar also identified as Ancient Sarasvati river, located about 400 km from Delhi. <br>
        It is the administrative headquarter of Hanumangarh District. The city was once called Bhatner (alternatively
        spelled Bhatnair) <br>
        because it was founded by king Bhupat in 255 AD. It remained in the <br>
        control of the Rajputs of Bhati clan and faced a historic siege by Timur in 1391, during which the Bhati Raput
        king <br>
        Dulachand lost the fort for a short time.[3] The fort was later occupied by Rao Jetsa of Bikaner.[4]</p>

        (Bhatner at that time) defended by its ruler Rao Daljit and his cousin with only 10,000 men. <br>
        Timur wrestled the fortifications, slayed all the men and enslaved all of the women and children of the Garrison
        along with their citizens.</p>
    <h2>Early modern period</h2>
    <p>Main articles: Bhatner and History of Bikaner <br>
        Hanumangarh was the kingdom of Bhati Rajputs and hence its earlier name was Bhatner. Maharaja Surat <br>
        Singh Rathore (b.1787 – d.1828) of Bikaner State won this fort on Tuesday. Since Tuesday is the <br>
        auspicious day of the Hindu deity Hanuman, Surat Singh renamed Bhatner to "Hanumangarh" - the Fort of <br>
        Hanuman the Hindu-deity. The 1700-year-old Bhatner fort is situated in the middle of Hanumangarh Town, <br>
        the description of which can be found in Ain-i-Akbari.[6] A famous Bhadrakali temple is situated near the <br>
        town on the banks of Ancient Sarasvati river(Ghaggar river).[5] <br>
