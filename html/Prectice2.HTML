    “In the last three years, we have witnessed significant progress, but women in poorer countries and poor and
    marginalized women in richer countries still suffer disproportionately from cervical cancer,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom
    Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “With enhanced strategies to increase access to vaccination, screening and
    treatment, strong political and financial commitment from countries, and increased support from partners, we can
    realize our vision for eliminating cervical cancer.</q>

  <hr>
  <p style="font-size: large;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Since the launch of the Global strategy to
    accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem three years ago, a further 30 countries,
    including countries with large populations and cervical cancer burden such as Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nigeria,
    introduced the HPV vaccine. As of today, 140 countries have introduced HPV vaccine into national immunization
    programmes.</p>
  <p style="font-size: large;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The global HPV vaccination coverage of girls
    that received at least one dose of HPV vaccine has increased to 21% in 2022 – exceeding the pre-pandemic levels for
    the first time. <br>
    If this rate of progress is maintained the world would be on track to meet the 2030 target to make HPV vaccines
    available to all girls everywhere.</p>
  <p style="font-size: large;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">WHO, in collaboration with GAVI and other
    partners, has initiated systematic efforts to catch-up vaccinations for girls who missed HPV vaccination as a result
    of pandemic disruptions and to revitalize HPV vaccination programmes towards reaching the 90% coverage target. </p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: large;">Computerworld (abbreviated as CW) is an
    ongoing[7] decades-old professional publication which in 2014 "went digital. <br>
    "[2] Its audience is information technology (IT) and business technology professionals,[8] and is available via a
    <br>
    publication website and as a digital magazine.

    As a printed weekly during the 1970s and into the 1980s, Computerworld was the <br>
    leading trade publication in the <br>
    data processing industry.[9][10] Based on circulation and revenue it was one <br>
    of the most successful trade <br>
    publications in any industry.[9] Later in the 1980s it began to lose its dominant position.[10]

    It is published in many countries around the world under the same or similar names. <br>
    Each country's <br>
    version of Computerworld includes original content and is managed independently. The parent company <br>
    of Computerworld US is IDG Communications.</p>
  <hr>
  <h1 style="background-color: blueviolet;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">History</h1>
  <mark>The publication was launched in 1967 by International Data Group in Boston, whose founder was Patrick J.
    McGovern</mark>
  <h2>Going international</h2>
  <p style="font-size: large;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The company IDG offers the brand
    "Computerworld" in 47 countries worldwide, the name and frequency differ slightly though.[13] When IDG established
    the Swedish edition in 1983 i.e., the title "Computerworld" was already registered in Sweden by another publisher.
    This is why the Swedish edition is named Computer Sweden [sv]. The corresponding German publication is called
    Computerwoche [de] (which translates to "computer week") instead.

    Computerworld was distributed as a morning newspaper in tabloid format (41 cm) in 51,000 copies (2007) with an
    estimated 120,000 readers. From 1999 to 2008, it was published three days a week, but since 2009, it was published
    only on Tuesdays and Fridays.</p>
