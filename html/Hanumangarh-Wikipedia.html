     Ghaggar also identified as Ancient Sarasvati river, located about 400 km from Delhi. It is the administrative <br> headquarter of Hanumangarh District. The city was once called Bhatner (alternatively spelled Bhatnair) <br>
      because it was founded by king Bhupat in 255 AD. It remained in the control of the Rajputs of Bhati clan and faced <br>
       a historic siege by Timur in 1391, during which the Bhati Raput king Dulachand lost the fort <br>
       for a short time.[3] The fort was later occupied by Rao Jetsa of Bikaner.</p>

                     of Bikaner State won this fort on Tuesday. Since Tuesday is the auspicious day of the Hindu deity Hanuman, Surat Singh renamed <br>
                      Bhatner to "Hanumangarh" - the Fort of Hanuman the Hindu-deity. The 1700-year-old Bhatner  fort is situated in the middle of <br>
