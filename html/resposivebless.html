        <p style="height: auto; width: 100%;">A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of
            arithmetic or logical operations
            (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations
            known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a
            nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral
            equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are
            linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.

            A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose
            devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots
            and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices
            like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.

            Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have
            aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical
            devices were built to automate long, tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated
            electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital
            electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in
            the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit
            chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the
            1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with
            transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital
            Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.

            Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central
            processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, together with some type of computer memory, typically
            semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a
            sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral
            devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers,
            etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral
            devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations
            to be saved and retrieved.</p>
