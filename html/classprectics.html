                A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical
                operations
                (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations
                known as programs. <mark>These programs enable computers</mark> to perform a wide range of tasks. A
                computer
                system is a
                nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral
                equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are
                linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.

                A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple
                special-purpose
                devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial
                robots
                and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices
                like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.

            <h1>Etymology</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first known use of computer was in a 1613 book called
                The
                Yong Mans Gleanings by the English writer Richard Brathwait: "I haue [sic] read the truest computer of
                Times, and the best Arithmetician that euer [sic] breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short
                number."
                This usage of the term referred to a human computer, a person who carried out calculations or
                computations.
                The word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century. During the latter part of
                this period women were often hired as computers because they could be paid less than their male
                counterparts.[1] By 1943, most human computers were women.[2]

                The Online Etymology Dictionary gives the first attested use of computer in the 1640s, meaning 'one who
                calculates'; this is an "agent noun from compute (v.)". The Online Etymology Dictionary states that the
                use
                of the term to mean "'calculating machine' (of any type) is from 1897." The Online Etymology Dictionary
                indicates that the "modern use" of the term, to mean 'programmable digital electronic computer' dates
                from
                "1945 under this name; [in a] theoretical [sense] from 1937,

                The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks. The Roman abacus was developed from devices used in
                Babylonia as early as 2400 BCE. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been
                invented. In a medieval European counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and
                markers
                moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.[5]


                The Antikythera mechanism, dating back to ancient Greece circa 150–100 BCE, is an early analog computing
                device.
                The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer, according to
                Derek J. de Solla Price.[6] It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in
                1901
                in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been
                dated
                to approximately c. 100 BCE. Devices of comparable complexity to the Antikythera mechanism would not
                reappear until the fourteenth century.[7]

                Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation
                use.
                The planisphere was a star chart invented by Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī in the early 11th century.[8] The
                astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BCE and is often
                attributed to Hipparchus. A combinatio

                Charles Babbage, an English mechanical engineer and polymath, originated the concept of a programmable

                and
                mathematical tables",[23] he also designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that
                a
                much more general design, an analytical engine, was possible. The input of programs and data was to be
                provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms
                such
                as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The
                machine
                would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an
                arithmetic
                logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making
                it
