               <b>Computerworld </b> <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">(abbreviated as CW) is an ongoing[7] decades-old professional publication which in 2014 "went digital. <br> "[2] Its audience is information technology (IT) and business technology professionals,[8] and is <br> available via a publication website and as a digital magazine.</p>
               <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;" >As a printed weekly during the 1970s and into the 1980s, Computerworld was the leading trade <br> publication in the data processing industry.[9][10] Based on circulation and revenue it was one <br> of the most successful trade publications in any industry.[9] Later in the 1980s it began to lose <br> its dominant position.</p>
               <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">It is published in many countries around the world under the same or similar names. Each country's <br> version of Computerworld includes original content and is managed independently. The parent <br> company of Computerworld US is IDG Communications.</p>
<h1>History</h1>
<hr>
<p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">The publication was launched in 1967 by International Data Group in Boston, whose founder was Patrick J. McGovern.</p>
<h2>Going international</h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;border: 3.5px solid;">The company IDG offers the brand "Computerworld" in 47 countries worldwide, the name and frequency differ slightly though. <br>[13] When IDG established the Swedish edition in 1983 i.e., the title "Computerworld" was already registered in Sweden by another publisher. <br> This is why the Swedish edition is named Computer Sweden [sv]. The corresponding German publication is called Computerwoche [de] <br> (which translates to "computer week") instead.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">Computerworld was distributed as a morning newspaper in tabloid format (41 cm) in 51,000 copies (2007) with an estimated 120,000 readers. <br> From 1999 to 2008, it was published three days a week, but since 2009, it was published only on Tuesdays and Fridays.</p>
<h2>Going digital</h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">In June 2014, Computerworld US abandoned its print edition, becoming an exclusively digital publication.[2] In July 2014, the publisher started <br> the monthly Computerworld Digital Magazine. In 2017 it published features and stories highlighting the magazine's history on the fiftieth anniversary. <br>[17]Computerworld's website first appeared in 1996.</p>
<h2>Ongoing</h2>
<hr>
<p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; border: 2.5px solid ;">Computerworld US serves IT and business management with coverage of information <u>technology</u> <br>[19] emerging technologies and analysis of technology trends.[20] Computerworld also publishes <br> several notable special reports each year, including the 100 Best Places to Work in IT,[7] IT Salary <br> Survey, the DATA+ Editors' Choice Awards and the annual Forecast research report. Computerworld in the <br> past has published stories that highlight the effects of immigration to the U.S. (e.g. the H-1B visa) <br> on software engineers.</p>
