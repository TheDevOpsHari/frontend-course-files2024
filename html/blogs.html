            computers were meant to be used only for
            calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since
            ancient
            times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long, tedious
            tasks,
            such as guiding patterns for A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of
            arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can
            perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide
            range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating
            system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also
            refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer
            cluster.

            A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose
            devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots
            and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices
            like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.

            electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital
            electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in
            the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit
            chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the
            1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with
            transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital
            Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.

            Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central
            processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, together with some type of computer memory, typically
            semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a
            sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral
            devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers,
            etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral
            devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations
            to be saved and retrieved. Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for
            astronomical and navigation use. The planisphere was a star chart invented by Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī in the
            early 11th century.[8] The astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd
            centuries BCE and is often attributed to Hipparchus. A combination of the planisphere and dioptra, the
            astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in
            spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer[9][10] and gear-wheels was
            invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235.[11] Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī invented the first mechanical
            geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe,[12] an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine[13] with a gear
            train and gear-wheels,[14] c. 1000 AD. In the 1770s, Pierre Jaquet-Droz, a Swiss watchmaker, built a
            mechanical doll (automaton) that could write holding a quill pen. By switching the number and order of its
            internal wheels different letters, and hence different messages, could be produced. In effect, it could be
            mechanically "programmed" to read instructions. Along with two other complex machines, the doll is at the
            Musée d'Art et d'Histoire of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, and still operates.[15]

            In 1831–1835, mathematician and engineer Giovanni Plana devised a Perpetual Calendar machine, which, through
            a system of pulleys and cylinders and over, could predict the perpetual calendar for every year from 0 CE
            (that is, 1 BCE) to 4000 CE, keeping track of leap years and varying day length. The tide-predicting machine
            invented by the Scottish scientist Sir William Thomson in 1872 was of great utility to navigation in shallow
            waters. It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set
            period at a particular location.

            The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by
            integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. In 1876, Sir William Thomson had
            already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, but he had been stymied by the limited
            output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators.[16] In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator
            drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The torque amplifier was the advance that
            allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, Vannevar Bush and others developed mechanical
            differential analyzers.

            In the 1890s, the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo began to develop a series of advanced analog
            machines that could solve real and complex roots of polynomials,[17][18][19][20] which were published in
            1901 by the Paris Academy of Sciences.[21]</p>
