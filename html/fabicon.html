    <H1>Anonymous (hacker group)</H1>
    <HR>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</HR>
    <p>Anonymous is a decentralized international activist and hacktivist collective and movement primarily known for
        its various cyberattacks against several governments, government institutions and government agencies,
        corporations and the Church of Scientology.

        Anonymous originated in 2003 on the imageboard 4chan representing the concept of many online and offline
        community users simultaneously existing as an "anarchic", digitized "global brain" or "hivemind".[2][3][4]
        Anonymous members (known as anons) can sometimes be distinguished in public by the wearing of Guy Fawkes masks
        in the style portrayed in the graphic novel and film V for Vendetta.[5] Some anons also opt to mask their voices
        through voice changers or text-to-speech programs.

        Dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks in countries including the United
        States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, South Africa,[6] Spain, India, and Turkey. Evaluations
        of the group's actions and effectiveness vary widely. Supporters have called the group "freedom fighters"[7] and
        digital Robin Hoods,[8] while critics have described them as "a cyber lynch-mob"[9] or "cyber terrorists".[10]
        In 2012, Time called Anonymous one of the "100 most influential people" in the world.[11] Anonymous' media
        profile diminished by 2018,[12][13] but the group re-emerged in 2020 to support the George Floyd protests and
        other causes.</p>

        other causes.[14][15</p>
    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The philosophy of Anonymous offers insight into a long-standing political question that has gone unanswered with
        often tragic consequences for social movements: what does a new form of collective politics look like that
        wishes to go beyond the identity of the individual subject in late capitalism?[16]

        Internal dissent is also a regular feature of the group.[17] A website associated with the group describes it as
        "an Internet gathering" with "a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather
        than directives"    .[17] Gabriella Coleman writes of the group: "In some ways, it may be impossible to gauge the
        intent and motive of thousands of participants, many of who don't even bother to leave a trace of their
        thoughts, motivations, and reactions. Among those that do, opinions vary considerably."[18]

        Broadly speaking, Anons oppose Internet censorship and control and the majority of their actions target
        governments, organizations, and corporations that they accuse of censorship. Anons were early supporters of the
        global Occupy movement and the Arab Spring.[19] Since 2008, a frequent subject of disagreement within Anonymous
        is whether members should focus on pranking and entertainment or more serious (and, in some cases, political)
        activism.[20][21]

        We [Anonymous] just happen to be a group of people on the Internet who need—just kind of an outlet to do as we
        wish, that we wouldn't be able to do in regular society. ...That's more or less the point of it. Do as you wish.
        ... There's a common phrase: 'we are doing it for the lulz.'

        — Trent Peacock, 'Search Engine: The Face of Anonymous, February 7, 2008.[22]
        Because Anonymous has no leadership, no action can be attributed to the membership as a whole. Parmy Olson and
        others have criticized media coverage that presents the group as well-organized or homogeneous; Olson writes,
        "There was no single leader pulling the levers, but a few organizational minds that sometimes pooled together to
        start planning a stunt."[23] Some members protest using legal means, while others employ illegal measures such
        as DDoS attacks and hacking.[24] Membership is open to anyone who wishes to state they are a member of the
        collective;[25] British journalist Carole Cadwalladr of The Observer compared the group's decentralized
        structure to that of al-Qaeda: "If you believe in Anonymous, and call yourself Anonymous, you are
        Anonymous."[26] Olson, who formerly described Anonymous as a "brand", stated in 2012 that she now characterized
        it as a "movement" rather than a group: "anyone can be part of it. It is a crowd of people, a nebulous crowd of
        people, working together and doing things together for various purposes."[27]

        The group's few rules include not disclosing one's identity, not talking about the group, and not attacking
        media.[28] Members commonly use the tagline "We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not
        forget. Expect us."[29] Brian Kelly writes that three of the group's key characteristics are "(1) an unrelenting
        moral stance on issues and rights, regardless of direct provocation; (2) a physical presence that accompanies
        online hacking activity; and (3) a distinctive brand."[30]

        Journalists have commented that Anonymous' secrecy, fabrications, and media awareness pose an unusual challenge
        for reporting on the group's actions and motivations.[31][32] Quinn Norton of Wired writes that: "Anons lie when
        they have no reason to lie. They weave vast fabrications as a form of performance. Then they tell the truth at
        unexpected and unfortunate times, sometimes destroying themselves in the process. They are unpredictable."[31]
        Norton states that the difficulties in reporting on the group cause most writers, including herself, to focus on
        the "small groups of hackers who stole the limelight from a legion, defied their values, and crashed violently
        into the law" rather than "Anonymous's sea of voices, all experimenting with new ways of being in the
        world".[31]</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <b>4chan raids (2003–2007)</b>
    <p>The name Anonymous itself is inspired by the perceived anonymity under which users post images and comments on
        the Internet. Usage of the term Anonymous in the sense of a shared identity began on imageboards, particularly
        the /b/ board of 4chan, dedicated to random content and to raiding other websites.[34] A tag of Anonymous is
        assigned to visitors who leave comments without identifying the originator of the posted content. Users of
        imageboards sometimes jokingly acted as if Anonymous was a single individual. The concept of the Anonymous
        entity advanced in 2004 when an administrator on the 4chan image board activated a "Forced_Anon" protocol that
        signed all posts as Anonymous.[35] As the popularity of imageboards increased, the idea of Anonymous as a
        collective of unnamed individuals became an Internet meme.[36]

        Users of 4chan's /b/ board would occasionally join into mass pranks or raids.[34] In a raid on July 12, 2006,
        for example, large numbers of 4chan readers invaded the Finnish social networking site Habbo Hotel with
        identical avatars; the avatars blocked regular Habbo members from accessing the digital hotel's pool, stating it
        was "closed due to fail and AIDS".[37] Future LulzSec member Topiary became involved with the site at this time,
        inviting large audiences to listen to his prank phone calls via Skype.[38][a] Due to the growing traffic on
        4chan's board, users soon began to plot pranks off-site using Internet Relay Chat (IRC).[40] These raids
        resulted in the first mainstream press story on Anonymous, a report by Fox station KTTV in Los Angeles,
        California in the U.S. The report called the group "hackers on steroids", "domestic terrorists", and an
        "Internet hate machine".[33][41]</p>

        world".[31]</p>
    <h2>Encyclopedia Dramatica (2004–present)</h2>
    <p>ncyclopedia Dramatica was founded in 2004 by Sherrod DeGrippo, initially as a means of documenting gossip related
        to LiveJournal, but it quickly was adopted as a major platform by Anonymous for parody and other purposes.[42]
        The not safe for work site celebrates a subversive "trolling culture", and documents Internet memes, culture,
        and events, such as mass pranks, trolling events, "raids", large-scale failures of Internet security, and
        criticism of Internet communities that are accused of self-censorship to gain prestige or positive coverage from
        traditional and established media outlets. Journalist Julian Dibbell described Encyclopedia Dramatica as the
        site "where the vast parallel universe of Anonymous in-jokes, catchphrases, and obsessions is lovingly
        annotated, and you will discover an elaborate trolling culture: Flamingly racist and misogynist content lurks
        throughout, all of it calculated to offend."[42] The site also played a role in the anti-Scientology campaign of
        Project Chanology.[43]

        On April 14, 2011, the original URL of the site was redirected to a new website named Oh Internet that bore
        little resemblance to Encyclopedia Dramatica. Parts of the ED community harshly criticized the changes.[44] In
        response, Anonymous launched "Operation Save ED" to rescue and restore the site's content.[45] The Web Ecology
        Project made a downloadable archive of former Encyclopedia Dramatica content.[46][47] The site's reincarnation
        was initially hosted at encyclopediadramatica.ch on servers owned by Ryan Cleary, who later was arrested in
        relation to attacks by LulzSec against Sony.[48]</p>

    <h2>Operation Payback (2010)</h2>
    <p>By the start of 2009, Scientologists had stopped engaging with protesters and had improved online security, and
        actions against the group had largely ceased. A period of infighting followed between the politically engaged
        members (called "moralfags" in the parlance of 4chan) and those seeking to provoke for entertainment
        (trolls).[66] By September 2010, the group had received little publicity for a year and faced a corresponding
        drop in member interest; its raids diminished greatly in size and moved largely off of IRC channels, organizing
        again from the chan boards, particularly /b/.[67]<img
            src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Anonymous-Bruxelles.jpg" height="200px width 280px"
            alt="" style="float: right;">

        In September 2010, however, Anons became aware of Aiplex Software, an Indian software company that contracted
        with film studios to launch DDoS attacks on websites used by copyright infringers, such as The Pirate
        Bay.[68][67] Coordinating through IRC, Anons launched a DDoS attack on September 17 that shut down Aiplex's
        website for a day. Primarily using LOIC, the group then targeted the Recording Industry Association of America
        (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), successfully bringing down both sites.[69] On
        September 19, future LulzSec member Mustafa Al-Bassam (known as "Tflow") and other Anons hacked the website of
        Copyright Alliance, an anti-infringement group, and posted the name of the operation: "Payback Is A Bitch", or
        "Operation Payback" for short.[70] Anons also issued a press release, stating:

        Anonymous is tired of corporate interests controlling the internet and silencing the people’s rights to spread
        information, but more importantly, the right to SHARE with one another. The RIAA and the MPAA feign to aid the
        artists and their cause; yet they do no such thing. In their eyes is not hope, only dollar signs. Anonymous will
        not stand this any longer.[71]

        As IRC network operators were beginning to shut down networks involved in DDoS attacks, Anons organized a group
        of servers to host an independent IRC network, titled AnonOps.[72] Operation Payback's targets rapidly expanded
        to include the British law firm ACS:Law,[73] the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft,[74] the British
        nightclub Ministry of Sound,[75] the Spanish copyright society Sociedad General de Autores y Editores,[76] the
        U.S. Copyright Office,[77] and the website of Gene Simmons of Kiss.[78] By October 7, 2010, total downtime for
        all websites attacked during Operation Payback was 537.55 hours.[78]

        In November 2010, the organization WikiLeaks began releasing hundreds of thousands of leaked U.S. diplomatic
        cables. In the face of legal threats against the organization by the U.S. government, Amazon.com booted
        WikiLeaks from its servers, and PayPal, MasterCard, and Visa cut off service to the organization.[79] Operation
        Payback then expanded to include "Operation Avenge Assange", and Anons issued a press release declaring PayPal a
        target.[80] Launching DDoS attacks with the LOIC, Anons quickly brought down the websites of the PayPal blog;
        PostFinance, a Swiss financial company denying service to WikiLeaks; EveryDNS, a web-hosting company that had
        also denied service; and the website of U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman, who had supported the push to cut off
        services.[81]

        On December 8, Anons launched an attack against PayPal's main site. According to Topiary, who was in the command
        channel during the attack, the LOIC proved ineffective, and Anons were forced to rely on the botnets of two
        hackers for the attack, marshaling hijacked computers for a concentrated assault.[82] Security researcher
        Sean-Paul Correll also reported that the "zombie computers" of involuntary botnets had provided 90% of the
        attack.[83] Topiary states that he and other Anons then "lied a bit to the press to give it that sense of
        abundance", exaggerating the role of the grassroots membership. However, this account was disputed.[84]
        The attacks brought down PayPal.com for an hour on December 8 and another brief period on December 9.[85]
        Anonymous also disrupted the sites for Visa and MasterCard on December 8.[86] Anons had announced an intention
        to bring down Amazon.com as well, but failed to do so, allegedly because of infighting with the hackers who
        controlled the botnets.[87] PayPal estimated the damage to have cost the company US$5.5 million. It later
        provided the IP addresses of 1,000 of its attackers to the FBI, leading to at least 14 arrests.[88] On Thursday,
        December 5, 2013, 13 of the PayPal 14 pleaded guilty to taking part in the attacks.[89]</p>
    <h2>2011–2012</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>In the years following Operation Payback, targets of Anonymous protests, hacks, and DDoS attacks continued to
        diversify. Beginning in January 2011, Anons took a number of actions known initially as Operation Tunisia in
        support of Arab Spring movements. Tflow created a script that Tunisians could use to protect their web browsers
        from government surveillance, while fellow future LulzSec member Hector Xavier Monsegur (alias "Sabu") and
        others allegedly hijacked servers from a London web-hosting company to launch a DDoS attack on Tunisian
        government websites, taking them offline. Sabu also used a Tunisian volunteer's computer to hack the website of
        Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi, replacing it with a message from Anonymous.[90] Anons also helped Tunisian
        dissidents share videos online about the uprising.[91] In Operation Egypt, Anons collaborated with the activist
        group Telecomix to help dissidents access government-censored websites.[91] Sabu and Topiary went on to
        participate in attacks on government websites in Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, Jordan, and Zimbabwe.[92]

        Tflow, Sabu, Topiary, and Ryan Ackroyd (known as "Kayla") collaborated in February 2011 on a cyber-attack
        against Aaron Barr, CEO of the computer security firm HBGary Federal, in retaliation for his research on
        Anonymous and his threat to expose members of the group. Using a SQL injection weakness, the four hacked the
        HBGary site, used Barr's captured password to vandalize his Twitter feed with racist messages, and released an
        enormous cache of HBGary's e-mails in a torrent file on Pirate Bay.[93] The e-mails stated that Barr and HBGary
        had proposed to Bank of America a plan to discredit WikiLeaks in retaliation for a planned leak of Bank of
        America documents,[94] and the leak caused substantial public relations harm to the firm as well as leading one
        U.S. congressman to call for a congressional investigation.[95] Barr resigned as CEO before the end of the
        month.[96]
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/AnonymousOccupy.jpg" height="200px width 280px" alt="" style="float: right;">

        Several attacks by Anons have targeted organizations accused of homophobia. In February 2011, an open letter was
        published on AnonNews.org threatening the Westboro Baptist Church, an organization based in Kansas in the U.S.
        known for picketing funerals with signs reading "God Hates Fags".[97] During a live radio current affairs
        program in which Topiary debated church member Shirley Phelps-Roper, CosmoTheGod hacked one of the
        organization's websites.[98][99] After the church announced its intentions in December 2012 to picket the
        funerals of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims, CosmoTheGod published the names, phone numbers,
        and e-mail and home addresses of church members and brought down GodHatesFags.com with a DDoS attack.[100] In
        August 2012, Anons hacked the site of Ugandan Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi in retaliation for the Parliament of
        Uganda's consideration of an anti-homosexuality law permitting capital punishment.[101]

        In April 2011, Anons launched a series of attacks against Sony in retaliation for trying to stop hacks of the
        PlayStation 3 game console. More than 100 million Sony accounts were compromised, and the Sony services Qriocity
        and PlayStation Network were taken down for a month apiece by cyberattacks.[102]

        In July 2011, Anonymous announced the launch of its social media platform Anonplus.[103] This came after
        Anonymous' presence was removed from Google+.[104] The site was later hacked by a Turkish hackers group who
        placed a message on the front page and replaced its logo with a picture of a dog.[105]

        In August 2011, Anons launched an attack against BART in San Francisco, which they dubbed #OpBart. The attack,
        made in response to the killing of Charles Hill a month prior, resulted in customers' personal information
        leaked onto the group's website.[106]</p>
