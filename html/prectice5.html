    <h1>Iron Man</h1>
    <p>
        Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and
        editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the
        character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963, and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968.
        Shortly after his creation, Iron Man was a founding member of a superhero team, the Avengers, with Thor,
        Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published
        consistently since the character's creation.

        Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs the
        company Stark Industries. Beginning his career as a weapons manufacturer, he is captured in a war zone, and his
        heart is severely injured by shrapnel. To sustain his heart and escape his captors, he builds a technologically
        advanced armor. After escaping, he continues using the armor as a superhero, creating more advanced models that
        grant him superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and other abilities. The character was used to explore
        political themes, and early Iron Man stories were set in the Cold War. Later stories explored other themes, such
        as civil unrest, technological advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.

    <h1>Publication history</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>Creation and premiere</h3>
    <p>Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of superhero comic books, Marvel
        set about creating new superhero characters.[1] During this time, Stan Lee developed the initial concept for
        Iron Man.[1] Lee was interested in making an unlikeable character likeable, saying that he "thought it would be
        fun to take the kind of character that nobody would like, none of [Marvel's] readers would like, and shove him
        down their throats and make them like him".[2] Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent arms industry
        developed in the United States, and this was incorporated into the character's backstory.[3] The character was
        introduced as an active player in the Vietnam War. Lee described the national mood toward Vietnam in which Iron
        Man was created as "a time when most of us genuinely felt that the conflict in that tortured land really was a
        simple matter of good versus evil".[4]

        As superhero comics became more popular, Marvel began replacing its previous comic book lines with superheroes.
        The monster-themed anthology series Tales of Suspense began running Iron Man stories alongside more traditional
        science-fiction and horror stories, featuring Iron Man on each cover.[5][6] Iron Man's first appearance, "Iron
        Man is Born!", was in Tales of Suspense #39, released in December 1962 with a cover date of March 1963. In 1964,
        the science-fiction and horror stories were removed entirely, with the series running only Iron Man and Captain
        America stories.[6]

        Larry Lieber developed Iron Man's origin and wrote the first Iron Man story, while Jack Kirby and Don Heck were
        responsible for the initial design.[1][7] Kirby initially drew Iron Man as a "round and clunky gray heap", and
        the design was modified by Heck to incorporate gadgets such as jets, drills, and suction cups. Heck continued as
        the primary Iron Man artist until 1965, as Kirby had obligations to other Marvel properties.[5][8] Heck later
        said that when designing Tony Stark, he was attempting to create "an Errol Flynn type".[9] Though the Iron Man
        armor was gray in its first appearance, it was quickly changed to gold due to issues with printing.[7] Lee
        briefly delegated the writing to other creators at Marvel, but he felt that their work was substandard; as with
        his other characters, Lee again took control of Iron Man so he could write the stories himself.[10] <br>
    <h3>1960s</h3> <br>
    When Marvel's distributor allowed them more monthly releases, The Avengers was developed as a new comic book
    series.[11] Iron Man was one of the five characters that formed the titular superhero team.[12] By 1965, the
    difficulty of maintaining continuity between The Avengers and the titles of the individual characters prompted Lee
    to write the original cast out of The Avengers, including Iron Man.[13]

    As part of a shuffling to match artists with the characters they were most suited for, Steve Ditko became the artist
    for Iron Man.[14] Ditko was responsible for only three issues in late 1963, but in this time he had Iron Man's suit
    redesigned with the red and gold color scheme that became the character's primary image.[15] Iron Man's recurring
    nemesis, the Mandarin, first appeared shortly after in Tales of Suspense #50.[16]

    Growing opposition to the American involvement in Vietnam prompted a shift in Iron Man's characterization at this
    time as part of a larger push by Marvel to be more apolitical.[4][17] Lee shifted the focus of Iron Man stories to
    espionage and domestic crime, incorporating the intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D. into these stories. They also
    incorporated the villains of other Marvel heroes, avoiding Iron Man's primarily communist rogues' gallery. Some of
    Iron Man's villains were given new motivations without their communist allegiances.[18]

    Previously relegated to short stories in an anthology series, Iron Man was one of several characters to receive a
    full length dedicated series in 1968.[19] The final issues of Tales of Suspense and Sub-Mariner's Tales to Astonish
    were combined as a one-shot special, Iron Man and Sub-Mariner.[20] Iron Man then began its run under writer Archie
    Goodwin.[21] Political themes were reintroduced slowly over the following years, with a focus on domestic issues
    like racial conflict and environmentalism rather than geopolitics.[22] <br>
    <h3>1970s</h3>
    <div style="border: 2px solid; height: 200px; width: 230px; text-align: center; background-color: lightyellow;">
        I don't feel Tony Stark is a dinosaur, a creature unable to change before the weight of time crushes him aside.
        Yeah, it is hard in 1977 to praise a millionaire industrialist, playboy and former munitions-manufacturer—but it
        isn't impossible to change that image. Which is what I plan to do.

        Bill Mantlo, Iron Man #100[23]
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: right;">Over the years, the letters to the editor column in several issues saw extensive political debate.[24] When Goodwin
        was made editor-in-chief, assigned Gerry Conway as the writer for Iron Man.[25] Conway began a four-year-long effort
        to reform Iron Man in 1971 with stories that directly addressed the character's history as a weapons
        manufacturer.[26] These stories were especially prominent during a run by Mike Friedrich, in which corporate reform
        of Stark Industries was a recurring subplot.[27]
    
        Iron Man was one of several Marvel characters that declined in popularity during the 1970s, and the series went for
        a period of time without a dedicated writer until Bill Mantlo took over in 1977.[28] The following year, David
        Michelinie and Bob Layton took charge of the series beginning with issue #116.[29][30] While inking the series,
        Layton used issues of GQ, Playboy, and electronics catalogues as visual references,[31] and they stayed informed on
        developments in real world technology so that the Iron Man armor would always be a more advanced version of what
        existed.[30] Layton was inspired by the vast collection of specialized outfits used by Batman when designing Iron
        Man's various armors.[32]
    
        In Iron Man #117 and #118, Michelinie and Layton replaced many elements that had developed in the series: they
        removed Iron Man's romantic interest, they removed the Life Model Decoys that served as robotic doubles of Tony
        Stark, and they had him move to a different home.[33] Iron Man's new romantic interest, Bethany Cabe, was introduced
        as a feminist character who worked as Tony Stark's bodyguard.[34] The largest change they made was making Iron Man
        an alcoholic.[33] This was unprecedented for a major comic book hero,[35] and for much of popular fiction.[36] This
        began the Demon in a Bottle story arc that ran from #120 to #128.[37] At the same time, they introduced the
        character of Justin Hammer, who became the main backer of several Iron Man villains.[38]</p>
