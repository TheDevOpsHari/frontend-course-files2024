    <p style="background-color: cornflowerblue; ">A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences
        of arithmetic or logical operations
        (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as
        programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally
        complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed
        and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function
        together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.

        A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose
        devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and
        computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like
        smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.</p>
