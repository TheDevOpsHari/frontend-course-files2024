            alt="" height="160px width 160px" style="float: right;"> Instagram[a] is an American photo and video sharing
        social networking service owned by Meta Platforms. It allows
        users to upload media that can be edited with filters, be organized by hashtags, and be associated with a
        location via geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can browse
        other users' content by tags and locations, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add
        their content to a personal feed.[11] A Meta-operated image-centric social networking service, available on iOS,
        Android, Windows 10, and the web. Users can take photos and edit them using built-in filters and other tools,
        then share them on other social media platforms like Facebook. It supports 25 Instagram was originally
        distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square (1:1) aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the
        display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this restriction was eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. It
        also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a Stories
        feature—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which allowed users to post their content to a sequential feed,
        with each post accessible to others for 24 hours. As of January 2019, Stories is used by 500 million people
        daily.[11]

        Originally launched for iOS in October 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, Instagram rapidly gained
        popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion by June 2018.
        In April 2012, Facebook Inc. acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. The Android
        version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS
        app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. As of October 2015, over 40 billion photos had been
        uploaded. Although often admired for its success and influence, Instagram has also been criticized for
        negatively affecting teens' mental health, its policy and interface changes, its alleged censorship, and illegal
        and inappropriate content uploaded by users.

        Facebook is an online social media and social networking service owned by American technology giant Meta
        Platforms. Created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with four other Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo
        Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from the face book directories
        often given to American university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually
        expanding to other North American universities. Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years
        old (or older), except in the case of a handful of nations, where the age limit is 14 years.[6] As of December
        2022, Facebook claimed 3 billion monthly active users.[7] As of October 2023 Facebook ranked as the 3rd most
        visited website in the world with 22.56% of its traffic coming from the United States.[8][9] It was the most
        downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[10 2003–2006: Thefacebook, Thiel investment, and name change

        Zuckerberg built a website called "Facemash" in 2003 while attending Harvard University. The site was comparable
        to Hot or Not and used "photos compiled from the online face books of nine Houses, placing two next to each
        other at a time and asking users to choose the "hotter" person".[15] Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000
        photo-views in its first four hours.[16] The site was sent to several campus group listservs, but was shut down
        a few days later by Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged with breaching security,
        violating copyrights and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.[15] Zuckerberg
        expanded on this project that semester by creating a social study tool. He uploaded art images, each accompanied
        by a comments section, to a website he shared with his classmates.[17]

        A "face book" is a student directory featuring photos and personal information.[16] In 2003, Harvard had only a
        paper version[18] along with private online directories.[15][19] Zuckerberg told The Harvard Crimson,
        "Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard. ... I think it's kind of silly that
        it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can
        do it in a week."[19] In January 2004, Zuckerberg coded a new website, known as "TheFacebook", inspired by a
        Crimson editorial about Facemash, stating, "It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized
        Website is readily available ... the benefits are many." Zuckerberg met with Harvard student Eduardo Saverin,
        and each of them agreed to invest $1,000 ($1,549 in 2022 dollars[20]) in the site.[21] On February 4, 2004,
        Zuckerberg launched "TheFacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com.[22]
