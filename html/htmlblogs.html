        <p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out
            sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic
            computers
            can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide
            range of tasks. <img src="img/View_of_Bhagat_Singh_Chowk_in_Hanumanagrh.jpg" alt="" style="float: right;">

        <p>A broad range of industrial and consumer products use
            computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are
            included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as
            general-purpose
            devices like personal <img src="img/View_of_Bhagat_Singh_Chowk_in_Hanumanagrh.jpg" alt=""

        <p>Early computers were meant to be used only for
            calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since
            ancient
            times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long, tedious
            tasks,
